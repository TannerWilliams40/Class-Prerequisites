As it stands, we have a way to store all the values needed for courses and students and the totals for each. We still are going to need to associate prereqs and students, which we can do with concatenation. After concatenating, we will need to parse through to search and read in the data. We probably have 50% of our total code written, we just need to change the csv to be able to read in, and put functions in place for concatenating and parsing.
