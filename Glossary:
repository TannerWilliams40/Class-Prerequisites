Glossary:

Student - A student has attributes and takes classes at the university given in this scenario.

Course - Courses are the timeslots when a class is taught. These are attended by students have attributes that interact with students and prereqs.

Prereq - A prereq is a course that is required to take another course. In this implementation, a student will not be allowed to take a course if they have not taken all the prereq courses required.

ID - A student ID is a number that is assocated with every student in order to explicitly differentiate them.

studentIDs - A vector that contains the ID number associated with each student name.

studentInCourse - A vector that holds how many students are taking a class that is parallel to the courses vector.

coursesPerStudent - A vector that holds how many courses a student is taking that is parallel to the studntIDs vector.

courses - A vector that holds courses and the associated prerequisite classes that is parallel to advancedCourse.

advancedCourse - A vector that holds just base class values.

studentNames - A vector that holds name values of students and is parallel with studentIDs.

getCourses - function that returns the total number of courses in the system.

getStudents - function that returns the total number of students in the system.

checkPrereq - function that returns whether or not a class has a prerequisite class.

enroll - function that adds students and courses to the vectors and increments values in studentInCourse and coursesPerStudent where necessary

courseCheck - function that checks to see if an advanced course is put into the advancedCourse vector

associate - function that sets studentIDs and studentNames parallel

associated - function that checks to see if names and IDs are already associated

concatCourse - function that connects prerequisted courses to their base course

getCourseStudents - function that returns how many students are taking a given course
